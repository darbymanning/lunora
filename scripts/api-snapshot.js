/**
 * Public-API snapshot guard.
 *
 * Extracts every covered package's public API surface — export names, kinds, and
 * normalized declaration text per exports-map subpath — from the built
 * `dist/*.d.ts` entries, and pins it in committed `api-snapshots/<package>.api.md`
 * files. A breaking change to a covered surface must land together with an
 * explicit, reviewable snapshot update — it cannot ship on a reviewer's memory.
 * A source-shipping package (exports pointing at `.ts`/`.tsx` instead of a build
 * output) is extracted straight from that source instead — see `collectEntries`.
 *
 *   node scripts/api-snapshot.js check    # (default) fail if the surface drifted
 *   node scripts/api-snapshot.js update   # regenerate the snapshots
 *
 * Root scripts: `pnpm run api:check` / `pnpm run api:update`. CI runs the check
 * in the Lint workflow's `api-surface` job after `pnpm run build:packages`.
 *
 * Design notes (diff stability):
 * - Signatures are re-printed from the type AST with comments removed, so JSDoc
 *   or formatting churn in a declaration never fails the gate — only a change to
 *   the declaration itself does.
 * - `private` class members (emitted as bare `private name;` in .d.ts) are
 *   dropped — they are implementation detail, not API.
 * - Re-exports whose declarations live in ANOTHER package (sibling `@lunora/*`
 *   or third-party) are pinned by name + kind + source package only; their
 *   signature is tracked in the owning package's snapshot (siblings) or is a
 *   dependency's concern (third-party), so upstream text churn can't fail this
 *   package's gate.
 * - Exports tagged `@experimental` (JSDoc) are pinned by name + kind only and
 *   explicitly excluded from signature tracking, so the experimental tier can
 *   churn without a snapshot update. Adding/removing the tag IS a gated change.
 * - Internal `import("./packem_shared/…-<hash>.js")` specifiers inside type text
 *   are rewritten to `import("~internal")` so packem chunk-hash churn is inert.
 * - Exports are sorted by name; subpaths lexicographically with `.` first.

 * experimental tier (`replica`, `x402`, `react-native`, `angular`, `browser`,
 * `payment`) is not covered yet. `platform-celld` is likewise not covered: it is
 * a spike blocked as a runnable target on celld's planned `storage.sql` surface.
 *
 * `platform-node` was held out entirely while it was a plan-234 spike, on the
 * grounds that its surface was still expected to move. It now implements what it
 * declares — durable alarms, scheduler, sockets and shard state, a
 * `ShardDirectory` that dispatches, `.global()` tables, workflows and object
 * storage — so it is gated, at the tier `ROADMAP.md` publishes it in. Gating it
 * is how the second host's surface stops drifting from the contracts in
 * `platform` unnoticed, which is the whole reason those two are gated; TIER_1
 * would have been a 1.0 SemVer promise this package is nowhere near making, and
 * `check-roadmap-tiers` says so at install time.
 *
 * `auth-ui` IS covered (TIER_2) despite being `private: true` with no build
 * step — privacy and "no dist" are not exemptions (see `dispatch`, also
 * private, also covered). Its `core`/`react` exports point at `.ts`/`.tsx`
 * source and are extracted via the source-file fallback in `collectEntries`.
 * Only `./core` and `./react` are wired into its exports map today; `solid`,
 * `svelte`, `vue`, `angular` aren't covered until they are.

 * snapshot makes the drift visible, and the SemVer commitment still arrives
 * only at graduation.
 *
 * It costs little churn because the `@experimental` JSDoc rule above already
 * pins a tagged export by name + kind and skips its signature, and these

 * tagged, plus every export appearing or disappearing — which is exactly the
 * settling signal.
 *
 * `container` was added when `ctx.containers` gained a first-class `exec`
 * (plan 335). That change moved the package's public surface with nothing
 * watching: the plan asserted `api:check` would gate it, and `api:check` had
 * never heard of the package. `@lunora/agent` already consumes this surface —

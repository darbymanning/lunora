## Repository Overview

Lunora is a pnpm monorepo for the Lunora framework — a type-safe, real-time backend on Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects with a Vite-first DX.

**Package manager**: pnpm v11.15.0 (enforced via `packageManager`; `engines.pnpm` is `>=10.32.1`). **Monorepo orchestration**: @visulima/vis. **Node**: ^22.15.0 || >=24.11.0.

### Repo layout

pnpm workspaces are `apps/*`, `packages/*`, `examples/*`, `tests/*`. The rest of the top level is not a workspace:

| Path             | What it is                                                                                                                                    |

| `apps/*`         | `docs` (site), `studio` (admin UI), `playground` (dev app), `cloud` (hosted control plane).                                                   |
| `examples/*`     | Runnable example apps (`todo-app`, `blog`, `expo`, `payment-demo`, …).                                                                        |
| `templates/*`    | Whole-project starters fetched by `lunora init` (`next`, `nuxt`, `expo`, `standalone`, …).                                                    |
| `registry/*`     | Copy-in registry items installed with `lunora registry add` (`auth`, `auth-ui-*`, `ai`, …).                                                   |
| `tests/*`        | Cross-cutting suites: `e2e` (`@lunora/e2e`, Playwright) and `vis-templates`.                                                                  |
| `scripts/*`      | Repo checks + release helpers (`check-*.js` run from `postinstall`, `api-snapshot.js`).                                                       |
| `api-snapshots/` | Committed public-API snapshots, one `<pkg>.api.md` per package — gated by `pnpm run api:check`.                                               |
| `shared/`        | Bundler-inlined helpers, **not** a package. See [Top-level `shared/`](#top-level-shared--bundler-inlined-source-not-a-package).               |
| `protocol/`      | Wire-protocol spec + shared fixtures.                                                                                                         |
| `plugins/*`      | The Claude Code / Codex agent plugin (`plugins/lunora`) — the `packages/cli/skills` payload + the end-of-turn `lunora verify` hook.           |
| `plans/`         | Implementation plans handed to agents; `plans/README.md` is the index.                                                                        |

bash sdks/generated-check.sh      # generate each SDK into a scratch dir, then build + CALL it
```

> **`package.json` key-order gotcha.** Key order is enforced by its own CI job ("Lint (package.json sort)") and by **nothing else** — ESLint, Prettier, `lint:types`, `api:check`, and `dist:check` are all blind to it. So a hand-added block in the wrong position (classically `peerDependencies` placed above `devDependencies` instead of below) goes green locally and red in CI. Canonical order is whatever `vis sort-package-json` emits; run `pnpm run lint:package-json` (= `vis sort-package-json --check`) after editing any manifest.
>
> Note `vis sort-package-json --help` currently crashes ([visulima#741](https://github.com/visulima/visulima/issues/741)) whenever a command's help text contains a literal `{`, so its flags aren't discoverable that way. `--check`, `--sort-scripts`, `--indent`, `--ignore <glob>`, `--sort-order`, `--unsorted <section>`, and `--line-ending` all exist.

> **Stale-`dist` gotcha.** `dist/` is gitignored and built on demand. A raw `pnpm --filter … run test` / `lint:types` does **not** rebuild workspace dependencies, so if an upstream `@lunora/*` package's source changed you may hit stale-`dist` errors (`X is not a function`, "missing export"). Build first — `pnpm run build:packages` once, or `pnpm --filter "@lunora/<pkg>..." run build` (the trailing `...` includes dependencies) — or use `pnpm run test:affected` / `pnpm run lint:affected:types`, which build dependencies for you.

> **CI gates beyond lint/test.** Green `lint:*` + `test` locally is not enough — `api:check` and `dist:check` have their own CI jobs and fail on changes the linters cannot see. `api:check` compares each package's public surface against its committed `api-snapshots/<pkg>.api.md`; an intentional surface change needs `pnpm run api:update` **after a fresh build** (it reads `dist/`, so a stale build writes a wrong snapshot). `lint:package-json` (key order) and `lint:registry:sync` are likewise CI-only.

> **Don't use `pnpm -r run test`.** Running every package's vitest in parallel across the whole repo fails a different, arbitrary set each run (resource contention, not real failures). Use `pnpm run test` (vis orchestrates it), `pnpm run test:affected`, or a single `pnpm --filter "@lunora/<pkg>" run test`.

## Commit Convention

Angular-style conventional commits, enforced by hooks:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `docs`, `dx`, `refactor`, `test`, `workflow`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `types`, `wip`, `release`, `deps`, `revert`. Scope is typically the package name (e.g., `feat(runtime): add durable-object client`). Subject: imperative, lowercase, no period, max 50 chars. Do not author `release` commits by hand.

## Branch Strategy

- **alpha**: Primary development branch — most PRs target this (default branch)
- **main**: Stable releases
- **next/beta**: Pre-release channels
- Feature branches: `feat/name`, `fix/issue-number`

> **Never text-merge `pnpm-lock.yaml`.** After merging or rebasing onto the base branch, discard any conflicted lockfile and regenerate it (`pnpm install --lockfile-only`) — a hand-resolved lockfile installs a tree nobody has. CI builds `refs/pull/N/merge`, not your branch head, so a lockfile that only works on the head fails there and nowhere else.

## Architecture Overview

Lunora exposes a typed, chainable functional API (the `query`/`mutation`/`action` procedure builders) on top of Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects:

- **Default topology**: a single Durable Object per app — easiest to reason about, sufficient for most apps.
- **Opt-in sharding**: `.shardBy(key)` partitions state across many DOs by user/tenant/room.
- **Opt-in global replication**: `.global()` replicates a function/state across regions for low-latency reads.
- **Vite-first DX**: a Vite plugin powers codegen, server↔client type sync, and the dev server.
- **Type-safe end-to-end**: functions, queries, mutations, and subscriptions infer types from server to client.

## Package Structure

### Naming

The CLI binary is `lunora`. The npm scope is `@lunora/*`. The "main" server package is **`@lunora/server`** (directory `packages/server/`) — it exports `defineSchema`, `query`, `mutation`, `action`, and the function-context types. "Main runtime package" in docs/plans means `@lunora/server`.

There is an unscoped **umbrella** package `lunorash` (directory `packages/lunora/`; npm name is `lunorash` because `lunora` is taken on npm, but the directory and CLI bin stay `lunora`). It re-exports the base packages (`@lunora/server` + subpaths, `@lunora/values`, `@lunora/runtime`, `@lunora/do`, `@lunora/client`) via subpaths (`lunorash/server`, …) and ships the `lunora` CLI bin. Codegen emits `lunorash/*` imports in `_generated/*` when a project declares a `lunorash` dependency (else `@lunora/*`) — opt-in and backward-compatible. Add-ons/adapters/Vite plugin stay separate installs.

**Platform family (plan 114).** Multi-platform support is split into **contracts**, a host-neutral **engine**, and **one host package per target**:

- `@lunora/platform` — **contracts** (types + capability matrix, zero deps): `ShardHost`, `SocketHost`, `ShardDirectory`, `ShardKvStore`, `SchedulerHost`, the canonical binding `*Like` projections, `PlatformCapabilities`. The behavioural TCK lives at the `@lunora/platform/conformance` subpath (`/conformance/suite` is the workerd-safe pure suite; the barrel adds the `node:sqlite` reference host) — the TCK versions in lockstep with the contracts it asserts, and a subpath keeps the root import types-only.
- `@lunora/shard-engine` — the host-neutral reactive engine (extracted from `@lunora/do`): per-shard state, OCC, CDC, reactive subscriptions, the poke protocol. Mountable on any host.
- `@lunora/platform-cloudflare` — the Cloudflare **host**: the contracts implemented over Durable Object primitives, plus the composition roots (`createShardPlatform` / `createWorkerPlatform`). `@lunora/do` depends on it and stays the Durable Object class itself; app code never imports it directly.
- `@lunora/platform-node` — the Node **host** (plan 234). Implements what it declares: durable alarms/scheduler/sockets/shard state, a `ShardDirectory` that dispatches, `.global()` tables over `@lunora/sql-store`, workflows and object storage, plus a `@lunora/config` deploy driver. Still **experimental** and still not a shipping target — there is no `lunora dev --target node`, and `NODE_CAPABILITIES` rates most features `emulated` rather than `native`. It is gated by the API-snapshot guard at the **experimental** tier — the snapshot records how the surface moves and carries no SemVer promise (`ROADMAP.md` publishes the tier, and `check-roadmap-tiers` fails the install if the two disagree).
- `@lunora/platform-celld` — the celld **host**, an experimental spike. celld (denoland/celld) is a self-hosted distributed Durable Objects daemon that executes Wrangler bundles, so this package recomposes `@lunora/platform-cloudflare`'s adapters under `CELLD_CAPABILITIES` rather than reimplementing them. Blocked as a runnable target on celld's planned D1-compatible `storage.sql` surface (`localSql` is `unsupported`); no dev wiring, no deploy driver.
- `@lunora/observability` — host-neutral telemetry (logs, metrics, traces, issues), also extracted from `@lunora/do`.

Each host is its own `@lunora/platform-<target>` package — never a subpath of the contracts package, since each carries its own provider deps. `@lunora/platform` stays zero-dependency.

### Packages

Concise roles below — read the package's `src/` and `docs/` for detail. Flags: **Internal** = supporting layer, depend on the CLI/Vite/runtime that uses it; **not published** = build-time only; **Experimental** = outside the 1.0 stability promise.

| `@lunora/do`                  | `ShardDO` (SQLite, OCC, hibernated WS subscriptions) and `SessionDO`.                                                                                                                                                     |

### Layout

Every package follows the same shape:

- `src/index.ts` — main export
- `__tests__/` — Vitest tests (`.test.ts` or `.spec.ts`)
- `vitest.config.ts` — per-package test config
- `tsconfig.json` — extends `../../tsconfig.base.json`
- `project.json` — vis metadata with tags (`type:package`, `category:<slug>`)
- `package.json` — ESM (`"type": "module"`), `"sideEffects": false`, conditional exports
- `.releaserc.json` — extends `@anolilab/semantic-release-preset/pnpm`

## Conventions & Best Practices

**Research the codebase before editing. Never change code you haven't read.**

- **Do not preserve backward compatibility — on pre-release branches only.** On `alpha` (and `next` / `beta`), packages are pre-1.0 (`1.0.0-alpha.*`): change the API, delete the old path, and update all call sites in the same change — no deprecated aliases, no `legacy*` shims, no dual code paths kept alive "just in case". Say so in the commit body so semantic-release records the break. **On `main` the opposite holds** — `main` carries stable releases, so keep the existing API working, deprecate before removing, and land the removal on a pre-release branch. Check the branch before you decide (`git branch --show-current`); when a change targets both, write it the `main` way.
- **Choose the simplest implementation that fully meets the current requirements.** Build for what is asked, not for a hypothetical future caller.
- **Avoid premature abstraction.** Prefer simple concrete solutions until a real pattern emerges. No config knobs, extension points, or abstraction layers with a single implementation until a second one actually exists.
- **Prefer established, well-maintained libraries over custom implementations.** Reach for a dependency before hand-rolling; add the version to the right catalog in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (see [Dependency Catalog](#dependency-catalog)). The exceptions are the zero-dep packages (`@lunora/errors`, `@lunora/fingerprint`, `@lunora/platform`) and `shared/`, which must stay dependency-free, plus anything that would not survive the Workers runtime.
- **Prefer composition over centralization.** Small focused modules with explicit interfaces, not one central system everything routes through.
- **Keep responsibilities clear.** Keep modules focused; don't mix transport, orchestration, domain/workflow state, persistence, and infrastructure in the same unit.
- **Never skip verification.** Do not bypass required checks, tests, or quality gates — no `--no-verify`, no skipped/`.skip`ped tests, no silenced type errors or lint rules to get something green.

### Module imports — no `.js` extensions

Every package compiles with `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` (see `tsconfig.base.json`). Write relative imports **without** a file extension — `import { x } from "./foo"`, never `"./foo.js"`. Strip any `.js` extensions you encounter.

**The one exception is `@lunora/codegen`.** Its emitter (`packages/codegen/src/emit.ts`) deliberately writes `.js` extensions into the code it _generates_, because `_generated/*` is consumed under NodeNext where the extension is mandatory. So `.js` is correct inside codegen template/string literals, `_generated/` output, golden fixtures, and the assertions verifying emitted output — leave those alone. Only the codegen package's own real `import`/`export` statements follow the no-extension rule.

When stripping extensions in bulk, use an AST-aware codemod (e.g. ts-morph, already a dependency), not a regex — only real import/export/`import()`/`require()`/`vi.mock()` specifiers should change, never extension-bearing strings in comments, assertions, or template-literal fixtures.

### Exports — no mixed default + named

**Never mix a default export with named exports in the same file.** If a file has more than one export, use **named exports only**. A `default` export is allowed only when it is the file's _sole_ export — this keeps import sites uniform and avoids default-vs-named ambiguity.

When a third-party API insists on a default export (e.g. `@visulima/cerebro`'s lazy `loader: () => import("./handler")`), do **not** add a `default` alongside named exports. Adapt at the call site instead — `loader: () => import("./handler").then((m) => ({ default: m.execute }))`.

### Platform parity — state the mapping when you add a feature

Every new `ctx.*` surface or binding states its mapping **per target**, or its
explicit non-support, in the same change that adds it:

- Add the feature to `PlatformCapabilities` in `@lunora/platform` and rate it
  `"native" | "emulated" | "unsupported"` for each target in the matrix
  (`CLOUDFLARE_CAPABILITIES`, and any sibling target that exists).
- If it is host-backed, say which contract carries it — or add one. A feature
  that reaches past `ShardHost`/`SocketHost`/`ShardDirectory`/`ShardKvStore`/
  `SchedulerHost` into a provider API is a porting blocker, and the time to
  notice is while writing it.
- If a target cannot serve it, `"unsupported"` is a fine answer. Codegen omits
  the surface and emits a `platform_unsupported_feature` diagnostic; silence is
  what causes the second host to discover the gap at runtime.

This is a process control, not paperwork. The matrix is what codegen trusts to
decide whether an app can target a host, and it is only honest if it is updated
by the person who already knows the answer. Two contracts have shipped wrong in
exactly the way this prevents — `ShardSqlExec` promised a field nothing read and
omitted three the engine used, and the canonical binding `*Like` types drifted
from the real ones because nothing consumed them.

### Dependency Catalog

Shared dependency versions live in pnpm catalogs in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. Packages reference them as `catalog:test`, `catalog:lint`, `catalog:dev`, `catalog:tsc`, `catalog:types`, etc. **Never** hard-code a version that already lives in a catalog.

### Top-level `shared/` — bundler-inlined source (not a package)

The repo root holds a **`shared/`** folder for tiny, dependency-free helpers that more than one package needs but that must **not** create a runtime dependency edge between those packages (e.g. `shared/stable-key.ts`, the `stableStringify` encoder used by `@lunora/client`, `@lunora/react`, and `@lunora/do`).

- **Not a package.** Consumers import it by **relative path** (`../../../shared/<file>`) and the bundler **inlines** it into each `dist` — no new dependency edge. Keep these files genuinely zero-dependency (relative or built-in imports only) or inlining breaks.
- **Tooling.** Prettier-formatted and type-checked transitively, but **outside per-package ESLint** — follow the no-`.js`-extension and named-export-only conventions by hand.
- **Consumer tsconfig.** A package importing `shared/*` must drop `outDir`/`rootDir` from its `tsconfig.json` (a set `rootDir` raises TS6059 for the out-of-package file under `tsc --noEmit`). A breadcrumb comment in each such tsconfig explains the divergence.
- **Don't reach for `shared/` first.** Prefer a real `@lunora/*` package when a runtime dependency edge is acceptable; `shared/` is only for the no-coupling, inline-only case.

### Pre-commit Hooks

Git hooks are **vis-native** (no husky). Committed scripts live in `.vis/hooks/`, run via a generated dispatcher at `.vis/hooks/_/` (gitignored); the root `prepare` script (`vis hook install`) wires `core.hooksPath` on every `pnpm install`. The pre-commit stage runs (via `vis.config.ts`, `set -e`):

- `vis secrets --staged` — gitleaks-compatible scan over staged files (aborts before linting on detection).
- `vis staged` — per-glob commands from the top-level `staged` block (Prettier + ESLint on code, Prettier on Markdown).

If hooks aren't firing, run `pnpm exec vis hook install` (or `vis hook validate` to diagnose).

**Order matters when fixing by hand: Prettier first, then ESLint.** `prettier --write` followed by `eslint --fix`. The reverse order lets Prettier reformat lines ESLint just fixed and reintroduce the violations.

### Release

Independent per-package versioning via `multi-semantic-release`. Publishable packages ship a `.releaserc.json` extending `@anolilab/semantic-release-preset/pnpm`. Conventional Commits drive bumps; the `semantic-release.yml` workflow publishes on push to `alpha` / `main` / `next` / `beta`. Do not author `release` commits manually.

### Internal scaffolding (`vis generate`)

Adding a query/mutation/action/table/cron to `lunora/`, or a fresh `@lunora/<name>` package, is done with `vis generate` (templates at `.vis/templates/lunora-*.ts`). There is no `lunora new` subcommand.

```bash
vis generate lunora-query --name=listMessages              # → lunora/listMessages.ts
vis generate lunora-mutation --name=sendMessage
vis generate lunora-action --name=syncWithStripe

**`--name` flag:** vis parses space-separated `--name listMessages` as `--name=true` + a stray positional. **Always use `--name=value`** (same for any string option on `vis generate`).

End-user scaffolding (`lunora init`) is unaffected — it fetches whole-project templates remotely via `giget` from `gh:anolilab/lunora/templates/<type>#alpha`.

## Agent Worktree Isolation

When spawning sub-agents via the Agent tool in this repo, default to `isolation: "worktree"` so the agent works on an isolated git worktree and cannot stomp on uncommitted changes in the main checkout.

- **Use worktrees for** any agent that edits/writes/refactors code, and long-running implementation tasks where the user may keep working in the main tree.
- **Skip worktrees for** read-only research/search agents (`Explore`, `Plan`, `general-purpose` used purely for research) and quick one-shot lookups where install/vis-cache overhead outweighs the benefit.
- **Costs:** each worktree needs a fresh `pnpm install` (store shared, `node_modules` per-worktree); vis cache (`.vis/`) starts cold; a branch checked out in one worktree can't be checked out in another; non-empty worktrees must be cleaned up with `git worktree remove` (empty ones auto-clean).
- **Repo-local git config** (apply once): `rerere.enabled = true` (reuse conflict resolutions across rebases), `worktree.guessRemote = true` (auto-track matching remote branch). `.worktrees/` is gitignored.
- **Commands:** `git worktree list` / `git worktree prune` / `git worktree remove <path>` (refuses if dirty; `--force` to override).

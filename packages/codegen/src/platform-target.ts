/**
 * Target-awareness for codegen (plan 114, §5.5).
 *
 * Codegen emits the same `ctx.*` surface regardless of where the app deploys.
 * That is correct for Cloudflare — the reference target, whose capability
 * matrix marks every feature `native` or `emulated` — but a different host may
 * not provide a given primitive at all. This module intersects what the app
 * uses (the {@link FeatureUsage} probe) with what the target supports (its
 * `@lunora/platform` {@link PlatformCapabilities} matrix): a feature the app
 * uses that the target marks `unsupported` is dropped from the emitted surface
 * and reported as a {@link PlatformDiagnostic}, so a portability gap is a
 * build-time signal rather than a runtime surprise. A feature the app uses
 * that the matrix does not rate AT ALL — every `features` key is optional —
 * is treated the same way (dropped, diagnosed) rather than left in: an
 * un-rated feature fails closed under its own `platform_undeclared_feature`
 * name, so a partial matrix from a WIP second host cannot silently emit a
 * surface for a primitive it never claimed to support.
 *
 * `native` and `emulated` both emit as-is — `emulated` means Lunora builds the
 * feature on lower-level primitives, which is still a working surface.
 *
 * Cloudflare, Node, and celld are registered (their matrices live in
 * `@lunora/platform` as `CLOUDFLARE_CAPABILITIES` / `NODE_CAPABILITIES` /
 * `CELLD_CAPABILITIES`); other hosts register their matrices as their
 * per-target `@lunora/platform-<target>` packages land.
 * An unregistered `target` is a configuration error, reported as
 * `platform_unknown_target` — and, crucially, the usage set is left untouched
 * so codegen never silently omits a surface against a matrix it does not have.
 *
 * `node` is registered here even though `@lunora/platform-node` (plan 234) is a
 * spike with no `lunora dev`/deploy wiring and no `@lunora/config` deploy
 * driver — see that package's README and `plans/234-node-host-findings.md`.
 * Registering it is what actually exercises 229's fail-closed capability gate
 * against a matrix that is mostly `unsupported`/`emulated`, which is the point
 * of this module existing before a second host does. It also means
 * `platformMatrixIds()` and `@lunora/config`'s `deployTargetIds()` now
 * disagree — `@lunora/config`'s driver registry has no `node` entry, because a
 * spike host with no deploy story is not a deploy target. That is flagged, not
 * silently reconciled, in `plans/234-node-host-findings.md`: the two registries
 * conflate "codegen can gate capabilities for this" with "the CLI can deploy to
 * this," and `node` is the first target where those two questions have
 * different answers.

 * a target without the binding fails at runtime, so codegen must omit the
 * surface and emit `platform_unsupported_feature` instead. A key with no
 * entry is **credential-based** (genuinely target-agnostic): it works
 * anywhere `fetch` works, given an API token, so it is never gated and
 * always emitted, on every target — feature flags (`flags`), the
 * Cloudflare-Access identity facade (`access`), payments (`payments`), and
 * x402 (`x402`). `r2sql` is deliberately unmapped for the same reason: the
 * R2 SQL client is a plain HTTP client over an API token, not a binding.
 *
 * `access` stays unmapped even though the matrix now rates `identityProxy`,
 * and the distinction is the point: `identityProxy` records whether the *host*
 * can hand the runtime a pre-authenticated identity out-of-band, while the
 * `ctx.access` facade `access` gates works on any target, because
 * `@lunora/cloudflare-access` falls back to verifying the
 * `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` header — a plain HTTP check needing no host
 * support. Gating the facade on the rating would drop a surface that still
 * functions.
 *
 * `shardAlarms` is deliberately unmapped here, and not because it was
 * forgotten: `CapabilityKey` is derived from `CAPABILITY_ROWS`, which
 * enumerates app-imported `ctx.*` add-on modules, and there is no such usage
 * key for alarms because they are an engine-internal contract member, never
 * something an app imports. There is nothing for this map to gate on. Its
 * `PlatformCapabilities` rating still matters for Studio parity reporting and
 * any future target-level check — see its `shardAlarms` entry in the Node
 * capability matrix (`NODE_CAPABILITIES` in `@lunora/platform`, plan 267).

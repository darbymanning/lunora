/**
 * `@lunora/platform` — provider-neutral host contracts for Lunora.
 *
 * This package defines the structural interfaces that separate the Lunora
 * engine from any specific host (Cloudflare Workers, AWS, Rivet, Node, etc.).
 * It contains **types and capability metadata only** — near-zero runtime code.
 *
 * The contracts fall into four groups:
 *
 * 1. **Shard host** (`ShardHost`) — single-writer execution, transactions,
 * local SQL, alarms, and background continuation per shard key.
 * 2. **Socket host** (`SocketHost`) — hibernated WebSocket subscriptions with
 * durable attachments and tagged fan-out.
 * 3. **Shard directory** (`ShardDirectory`) — deterministic placement and RPC
 * dispatch from shard keys to stubs.
 * 4. **Scheduler host** (`SchedulerHost`) — durable delayed jobs, cron, and
 * at-least-once dispatch.
 *
 * Plus canonical binding projections (`KVNamespaceLike`, `R2BucketLike`,
 * `QueueBindingLike`, `D1DatabaseLike`, `VectorizeIndexLike`, …) and the
 * `PlatformCapabilities` matrix that codegen uses to tailor emitted types per
 * target.
 *
 * This package is **zero-dependency** and safe on every runtime (browser,
 * workerd, Node). It is intended to be the leaf dependency every other
 * `@lunora/*` package can import without creating cycles.

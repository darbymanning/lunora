 * `better-sqlite3` and an in-process registry, built to run the conformance
 * TCK against a second host and discover what the contracts under-specify.
 * It is a single Node process with no distributed placement, no host-level
 * scheduler to re-arm timers after a restart, and no bindings at all for the
 * Cloudflare-specific products (R2, Vectorize, Workers AI, Queues,
 * Workflows, Containers, Browser Rendering, Analytics Engine, Secrets Store,
 * Hyperdrive) most `ctx.*` surfaces are built on. Every one of those is
 * rated `"unsupported"` here rather than left undeclared — see
 * `gateAgainstMatrix` in `@lunora/codegen`, whose fail-closed gate (plan
 * 229) treats an undeclared feature as unsupported anyway, but under a
 * different diagnostic name than an honest, explicit rating.
 *
 * Two features are rated `"emulated"` rather than `"native"` even though
 * this package fully implements their contract, because "native" would
 * overstate what a bare Node process provides on its own: `keyValueStore` is
 * a SQL table wearing a KV-shaped API, not a dedicated KV product, and
 * `websocketHibernation` never actually evicts a socket to save memory — it
 * only proves the attachment/tag durability half of the contract, not real
 * hibernation. `scheduler` and `shardAlarms` are rated `"unsupported"`, not
 * `"emulated"`: the Node host stores and times both, but its timer body only
 * clears bookkeeping — nothing dispatches the scheduled function or wakes the
 * alarm callback. `"emulated"` means built on lower-level primitives and
 * working; never-dispatched is not that (plan 267). `globalTables` is also
 * `"unsupported"` — no replicated SQL store is implemented. All ratings are
 * The celld capability matrix — `@lunora/platform-celld`'s honest self-rating.
 *
 * celld (github.com/denoland/celld) is a self-hosted, distributed Durable
 * Objects daemon: each node embeds V8, executes Wrangler bundles, and
 * coordinates ownership through an S3-compatible bucket instead of a control
 * plane. Because it implements the Workers/Durable Object API itself, the
 * Cloudflare host adapters are the celld host adapters — what differs is which
 * primitives exist, and that difference is exactly this matrix.
 *
 * Ratings derive from celld's documented compatibility surface
 * (`docs/cloudflare-compat.md`, `docs/limitations.md` in the celld repo, both
 * alpha), not from running the conformance TCK against a live fleet — celld is
 * an external daemon plus an object store, which unit tests cannot stand up.
 * The load-bearing entry is `localSql`: celld does not implement
 * `state.storage.sql`, and the shard engine's state is SQL-backed, so a Lunora
 * app cannot actually run on celld until celld ships its planned D1-compatible
 * SQL surface. Everything engine-dependent is therefore rated honestly against
 * that blocker rather than against the primitives it would use afterwards.
 * `websocketHibernation` is `emulated`, not `native`: the hibernation API is
 * implemented, but a cell with live sockets is protected from being shed
 * rather than evicted, so sockets never actually outlive their cell's memory.

/**
 * The Node capability matrix — `@lunora/platform-node`'s honest self-rating
 * (plan 234).
 *
 * `@lunora/platform-node` implements every contract in this package
 * (`ShardHost`, `SocketHost`, `ShardDirectory`, `ShardKvStore`,
 * `SchedulerHost`) over `better-sqlite3` and an in-process registry, plus the
 * `.global()` table backend via `@lunora/sql-store`. It began as a spike to run
 * the conformance TCK against a second host; the durability gaps that spike
 * surfaced — alarms and scheduler jobs that were persisted but never re-armed,
 * socket attachments that lived only in memory — are closed, and each is now
 * pinned by a restart test rather than only by a simulated recycle.
 *
 * `scheduler` and `shardAlarms` were rated `"unsupported"` under plan 267, on
 * the grounds that the host stored and timed both while its timer body only
 * cleared bookkeeping — nothing dispatched the scheduled function or woke the
 * alarm. That rating was correct for the code it described, and the code is
 * what changed: both now dispatch (through `onDispatch` / `onAlarm`) and both
 * re-arm from their durable rows on construction, so `"emulated"` — built on
 * lower-level primitives and *working* — is now the honest reading.
 *
 * What remains genuinely absent is everything a single Node process cannot
 * distribute: placement across nodes, failover, and most Cloudflare-specific
 * product bindings (Vectorize, Workers AI, Containers, Browser Rendering,
 * Analytics Engine, Secrets Store, Hyperdrive). Workflows, object storage and
 * queues are the three that CAN be emulated locally — `defineWorkflow` handlers
 * compile onto the `@visulima/workflow` engine, R2 becomes a filesystem bucket,
 * and Queues becomes a durable table with the same batch/ack/retry/dead-letter
 * semantics — so those three are rated `"emulated"`; the rest of the Cloudflare
 * products most `ctx.*` surfaces are built on are rated `"unsupported"` here
 * rather than left undeclared — see `gateAgainstMatrix` in `@lunora/codegen`,
 * whose fail-closed gate (plan 229) treats an undeclared feature as unsupported
 * anyway, but under a different diagnostic name than an honest, explicit rating.
 *
 * Almost nothing here is rated `"native"`, and that is the matrix's own
 * definition doing its job rather than a hedge: `native` means the platform
 * itself provides the feature, and a bare Node process provides essentially
 * none of them — Lunora builds alarms out of `setTimeout` plus a durable row,
 * a KV store out of a SQL table, and `.global()` tables out of a second SQLite
 * file. `localSql` is the exception, because SQLite genuinely is the platform
 * primitive there. The ratings say who does the work; the notes say how well.
 * Both are argued in detail in `plans/234-node-host-findings.md`.
